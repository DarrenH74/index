<h1> Introduction </h1>

<p> Hello, My name is Darren Higgins. I am 47 years of age and have spent the entirety of my life in Brisbane, QLD. Prior to starting this course my IT experience was basic everyday interaction. The majority of my life has been spent working in unskilled labour until 6 years
ago when my doctor gave me a choice: find a new career or end up paralysed from numerous back and nerve injuries.</p>

<p> I have spent the remaining years developing an interest and love of gaming and IT in general. I want to be able to use my imagination to achieve my dreams. I do have a very long term goal of hopefully one day contributing to humanity achieving
digital transference of our intellects and occupying entirely synthetic or cybernetic bodies. So... here's hoping. </p>

<p> My interest in IT started early in my life when computers first became common. I remember a neighbours father offered to take me to the first computing expo in Brisbane when I was around 11 or 12. I spent hours just mesmerised by what the promise of these machines was
and where the future could take us. I maintained a desire for IT and computing throughout my life but lacked the motivation and courage to attempt to learn how to properly enter the IT workforce.</p>

<p> I chose RMIT as it offered the spectrum of subjects that I was interested in and appeared to cater to my interests, I had tried other courses online and attempted a Certificate 3 in IT through TAFE QLD, but that course was as relevant to my interests as cave paintings are to rocket science. </p>

<p> I am under no illusions about how much I have to learn and the fact that it will be an uphill battle for me. But I am excited and looking forward to challenging myself intellectually instead of physically for a change </p>

<h1> My ideal job</h1>

<p>Software Developer
Sigma Bravo
Brisbane
CBD & Inner Suburbs
Information & Communication Technology
Developers/Programmers
Full Time </p>

<p> The Company
Sigma Bravo, a KBR Company, is a leader in Defence Mission Planning System development and integration. Sigma Bravo uniquely couple’s aviation mission planning environments, operational and engineering support, training, agile software development, and systems implementation, enhancing current Defence capabilities while designing the future military Mission Planning Environments.
Key Responsibilities
We are currently looking for a highly driven Software Developer to join an agile development team working on technology for the deployment of secure systems in support of Defence. You will be responsible for a variety of software development activities including library integration, bug identification and rectification, informal requirements analysis and provide support and training to military end users.
Due to the nature of Sigma Bravo's work, all applicants must have the ability to obtain a minimum of NV1 Security Clearance (usually only granted to Australian Citizens).
To be successful in this role you will need the following essential skills: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Object-Oriented software development experience using C# </li>
	<li> C# WPF Experience (highly desirable) </li>
	<li> Previous Off Board Mission Planning Experience (highly desirable) </li>
	<li> Development experience with C++ and/or Java </li>
	<li> Unit testing experience </li>
	<li> Experience dealing with customers / end users directly </li>
	<li> Experience in software development using Azure DevOps </li>
	<li> Ability to communicate effectively, both written and verbal, to technical and non-technical personnel </li>
	<li> Strong analytical skills with a methodical team focused approach </li>
	<li> Previous Defence experience in Joint Mission Planning System (desirable) </li>
</ul>
 
<p>What makes this an ideal job for me is that it is an industry that piques my interest : Cyber Security/Defense. The Defense industry is always looking for new methods of applying current technology and the IT industry is no exception. It can be said that IT is rapidly becoming an integral part of the Defense industry and to have a chance of being part of developing new cutting edge technologies would be a dream come true. </p>
<p>Skills I will need to develop for this position: </p>
<p>I will need to fundamentally improve my programming skills and fluency in several different programming languages. This comes mainly from practice, practice and more practice.  Some of the languages required are C++, C# and Java. As well as the languages needed I will also have to develop proficiencies in several Microsoft products such as Azure DevOps, a Microsoft product that resembles GitHub in its aims. I will also need to develop skills in using WPF, another Windows product used for constructing and managing user interfaces amongst other things.
Many of the skills required for the job also reflect a need to be able to effectively relay my knowledge to individuals who are not trained in IT. As well as interacting with individuals from varied career backgrounds involved in the defense industry.
Obviously, I have very few of these skills at the current moment, yet this job ad does give me a target baseline to aim for in what I need to train in. I will need to spend significant amounts of time invested in training myself in multiple programming languages and the varied technologies offered by Microsoft. I will also need to vastly improve my interpersonal skillset and my training skills. All of these can be improved through external training or life experience, however, with most skills they will require practice. </p>

<h1> Personality Profile: </h1>
<p> Myer Briggs test result </p>
<p> INTJ Architect type</p>
<p>“No escape from patterns and systems, no exits. Nothing, and no one, resides outside a
system; that’s the way it is.”
LYNNE TILLMAN </p>
<p> Armed with powerful intellects and strategic minds, Architects (INTJs) can outmaneuver obstacles that seem unbeatable to most. But their strengths, when misunderstood, can turn into weaknesses – and keep them from reaching their full potential. Those misunderstandings end here. What you have read so far is just an introduction – we have a
great deal more to tell you about the Architect personality type. In reading through this personality profile, you probably hit a tipping point. You went from trademark Architect skepticism to “Huh…” to “Wait, what?” You may even be a little uncomfortable, because you’re not used to being understood, even by the people closest to
you. Chances are you’ve accepted this as part of who you are and maybe even grown proud of it. But embracing that disconnect isn’t a requirement for Architects. It’s a misused defense mechanism, leading you down a lonely, inefficient path. Gaining insight into yourself and others is so much more rewarding – and effective. </p>

<h1> Big Five Personalities test result: </h1>
 <p> Neuroticism: 81; Extraversion : 46; Openness : 81; Agreeableness : 79; Conscientiousness :
102; </p>

<h1> Personality test conclusion </h1>
<p> These tests mostly reinforce what I already know about myself and how I learn. I am a very structured person and when those routines are disturbed it takes me a while to ‘reset’ so to speak. I’ve never been a social butterfly and prefer to just watch and learn from people. I tend not to do well in leadership positions as I expect my levels of conscientiousness from those under my leadership.</p>
<p>In team situations I am content to take directions from the team leader and if necessary ask for clarification if I can’t work something out myself. However I am more inclined to bang my head against the proverbial wall of ignorance until the problem finally clicks into place. </p>
<p>When forming teams I am quite content to do my part, I tend not to take leadership positions, because of the afore mentioned issues, but also my lack of interpersonal skills often make me seem like I am being confrontational when I am asking for updates on a task status. I am aware on the need for improving theses skills so as to improve my chances of employment in the IT industry and I am currently working through several techniques in improving them.</p>

<h1> My Project idea </h1>
<p>My project idea is to create a smartphone app for my sisters’ workplace. As it currently stands the staff have no way of communicating with the IT support team if they lose power or Internet connectivity. The standard ICT support policy is for all support issues to be
emailed to the ICT help desk, for obvious reasons this is difficult to do without internet connectivity and as their phone lines are connected to the Internet, when they lose online connections (apparently it happens on a daily basis), they also lose all phone lines. To
compound the situation the main servers for the company are located in their Headquarters in Johannesburg South Africa and are even more unreliable as vandalism often affects the
power supply to the office. </p>
<p> I want to do this as it is a good stepping stone into the larger software development world that I want to have a career in. I anticipate it will not be easy, and will require a lot of background work in learning the technologies involved in creating a smartphone app, and
liasing with a support department that appears to be more concerned with correct policy and procedure regardless of extenuating circumstances. I can also see a potential market for such an app. Maybe not something as massive as many other similar applications, but I am
confident that her workplace is not the only company in such a situation.</p>
<p> The app itself will have to be extremely user friendly as there are employees in her industry (mining) who are not so tech savy as others. To this end a simple ‘plug and play’ interface will have to be used. I won’t be putting to much information on the screen at any one time
as the apps sole purpose is to be able to remotely initiate a help desk ticket independent of the ICT support staff. I will need to obviously gain their agreement to be able to remotely
interact with their systems and to obtain a copy of their tickets so that it can be rendered into an easy to understand interface for users.</p>
<p> The majority of available help desk software is geared towards the ICT support desk itself and not towards customers who aren’t as skilled in IT. Many present an image that is just a
wall of text or is a simple messaging service. What is wanted by my sister and her co workers is something simple to use, they don’t want to fill in the whole of the help desk ticket, they just want to be able to inform the help desk that they have an issue and can
they raise a ticket to have it looked at. </p>
<p> The interface should be simple to enter info into with only the bare essentials needed. These essentials: The name of the staff member raising the issue, the workplace location, the nature of the issue, urgency of issue.
I will have to investigate template tools and work with the IT support team and my sister in seeing which interface is easiest to use. The app will have to be able to be used on both  Android and Apple systems as there is a pretty even distribution of both main smartphone
platforms at her workplace. Fortunately there is an abundance of templates and free or relatively cheap and easy to use platforms already to be used online and so I won’t have to
reinvent the wheel so to speak.</p>
<p> I don’t anticipate it to be easy for me to do this, but it is a goal worth working towards and hopefully I will be able to get support from outside bodies in my efforts. If the app is successful I may be able to roll it out for the entire multinational she works for. The wider
market of such an app could also be interesting, with a few cosmetic tweaks it may be able to be applied to other industries to make life a bit easier for staff who have limited IT knowledge. </p>
